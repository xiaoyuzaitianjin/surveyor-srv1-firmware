This site has been maintained so users of the old Surveyor SRV-1 Blackfin camera, robot and SVS Stereo Vision System could continue to access the source code "srv1.ldr" used for building firmware.

Also hosted here have been old control consoles for the Surveyor SRV-1 components:
SRV1Console.java, SRV1Test.java, and stereo.c (SVS) console source code.

blackfin/console/ subdirectory was the last post.

Surveyor Corp. has closed, along with the Surveyor User Forum and Surveyor components are no longer available.


A new set of components derived from the SRV have been developed and may be available soon. Anyone interested in ordering these new boards should submit their interest through the Contact Page at (http://www.engineering3.org/contact-e3/). Boards will not go into production for several weeks (as of Feb. 2015) but hopefully will be available to ship by mid Summer 2015.

Repositories for the new components are on Git Hub (https://github.com/Engineering-3). The Open Source licenses used for the original Surveyor components have been retained and extended for the new components.

The older files will remain here on the code.google site.



I'm not sure how current the info below may be but I'm leaving it here for now.


The links to GNU bfin-elf-gcc compiler toolchain used to build these firmware images has been removed (but may be added at some later date).
